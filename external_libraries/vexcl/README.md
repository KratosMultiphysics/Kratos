VexCL is a vector expression template library for OpenCL/CUDA. It has been
created for ease of GPGPU development with C++. VexCL strives to reduce amount
of boilerplate code needed to develop GPGPU applications. The library provides
convenient and intuitive notation for vector arithmetic, reduction, sparse
matrix-vector products, etc. Multi-device and even multi-platform computations
are supported. The source code of the library is distributed under very
permissive MIT license.
