## Fluid Dynamics Biomedical Application

The Fluid Dynamics Biomedical Application contains the biomedical Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) developments within Kratos Multiphysics.

### Features:

- This application derives from the base Fluid Dynamics Application

- Calculation of the Wall Shear Stress (WSS).

- Calculation of other blood flow related magnitudes (OSI, TWSS, ECAP, ...)

- Support for parabolic inlet profiles in arbitrary blood vessel geometries
