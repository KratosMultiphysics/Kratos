# Particle Mechanics Application

This application features continuum-based meshfree and particle methods with main motivations of simulating non-linear large deformable materials, such as free-surface flows, geomechanics phenomena, and extreme events involving impact, penetration, fragmentation, blast, multi-phase interaction, failure evolution, etc.

The recent research and development have been focused solely on the Material Point Method (MPM. However, the implementation of other continuum-based methods, e.g. the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), the Galerkin Meshfree Method (GMM), etc, is planned to be done within the same application in the future.

## Getting Started

This application is part of the Kratos Multiphysics Platform. Instructions on how to download, install and run the software in your local machine for development and testing purposes are available for both [Linux](http://kratos-wiki.cimne.upc.edu/index.php/LinuxInstall) and [Windows](http://kratos-wiki.cimne.upc.edu/index.php/Windows_7_Download_and_Installation) systems.

### Prerequisites

Build [Kratos](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki) and make sure the following lines are written:

``` cmake
-DEXTERNAL_SOLVER_APPLICATION=ON
-DPARTICLE_MECHANICS_APPLICATION=ON
```

between the compilation configurations, so the Particle Mechanics application is compiled along with auxiliary external solvers required.

## Theory

Particle or meshfree methods are a category of methods where the state of a system is represented by a set of discrete particles, without a fixed connectivity; hence, making such methods suitable for the analysis of moving discontinuities and large deformations with breaking and fragmentation. This approach does not suffer from the mesh distortion and entanglement issues posed by other Lagrangian discretizations such as the finite element method.

### Material Point Method

The MPM is a one of the Lagrangian particle methods which has gained a remarkably increasing popularity due to its capability in simulating solid mechanics problems involving historically dependent materials and large deformations. As MPM is able to combine the strengths of Eulerian and Lagrangian methods, it has been utilized in various engineering applications and industrial purposes, in particular in geomechanics and environmental fluid dynamics field. The method stores the historically changing variables and the material information at the moving particles, the so-called *material points* (MP), and uses a constantly-reset *background mesh* to solve the linear system of equations.
