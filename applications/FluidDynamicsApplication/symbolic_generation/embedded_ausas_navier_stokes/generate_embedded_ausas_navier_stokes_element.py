## Settings explanation
# DIMENSION TO COMPUTE:
# This symbolic generator is valid for both 2D and 3D cases. Since the element has been programed with a dimension template in Kratos,
# it is advised to set the dim_to_compute flag as "Both". In this case the generated .cpp file will contain both 2D and 3D implementations.
# LINEARISATION SETTINGS:
# FullNR considers the convective velocity as "v-vmesh", hence v is taken into account in the derivation of the LHS and RHS.
# Picard (a.k.a. QuasiNR) considers the convective velocity as "a", thus it is considered as a constant in the derivation of the LHS and RHS.
# DIVIDE BY RHO:
# If set to true, divides the mass conservation equation by rho in order to have a better conditioned matrix. Otherwise the original form is kept.
# ARTIFICIAL COMPRESSIBILITY:
# If set to true, the time derivative of the density is introduced in the mass conservation equation together with the state equation
# dp/drho=c^2 (being c the sound velocity). Besides, the velocity divergence is not considered to be 0. These assumptions add some extra terms
# to the usual Navier-Stokes equations that are intended to act as a soft artificial compressibility, which is controlled by the value of "c".
# In the derivation of the residual equations the space variations of the density are considered to be close to 0.
