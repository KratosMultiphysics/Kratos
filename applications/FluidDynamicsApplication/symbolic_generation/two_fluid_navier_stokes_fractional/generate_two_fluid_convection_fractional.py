## Settings explanation
# DIMENSION TO COMPUTE:
# This symbolic generator is valid for both 2D and 3D cases. Since the element has been programed with a dimension template in Kratos,
# it is advised to set the dim_to_compute flag as "Both". In this case the generated .cpp file will contain both 2D and 3D implementations.
# LINEARISATION SETTINGS:
# FullNR considers the convective velocity as "v-vmesh", hence v is taken into account in the derivation of the LHS and RHS.
# Picard (a.k.a. QuasiNR) considers the convective velocity as "a", thus it is considered as a constant in the derivation of the LHS and RHS.
