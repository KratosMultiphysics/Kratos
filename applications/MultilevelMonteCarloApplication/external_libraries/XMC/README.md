# XMC

[![DOI][DOI-image]][DOI]

**XMC** is a Python library for parallel, adaptive, hierarchical Monte Carlo algorithms, aiming at reliability, modularity, extensibility and high performance.

**XMC** is developed within the [ExaQUte](http://exaqute.eu/) European H2020 project.

**XMC** is **free** under BSD-4 license.

## Main features
The algorithms **XMC** can run include:
- Monte Carlo,
- Multilevel Monte Carlo,
- Continuation Multilevel Monte Carlo,
- Asynchronous Monte Carlo and Multilevel Monte Carlo.

## Documentation and usage
Documentation can be found in `doc/html/`, in docstrings in the code and [there](https://doi.org/10.23967/exaqute.2021.2.024). 
In particular, see `doc/html/start.html` for help in installing and configuring XMC.
Some examples and validation benchmarks can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/RiccardoRossi/exaqute-xmc/-/tree/development/examples/).

## External collaborations
**XMC** is integrated with [Kratos Multiphysics](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos) as solver software.

## How to cite XMC?
All the necessary metadata, as well as formatted citations, are provided on the [Zenodo record](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3235832).
