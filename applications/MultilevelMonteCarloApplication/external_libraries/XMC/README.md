# XMC

[![DOI][DOI-image]][DOI]

**XMC** is a Python library for parallel, adaptive, hierarchical Monte Carlo algorithms, aiming at reliability, modularity, extensibility and high performance.

**XMC** is developed within the [ExaQUte](http://exaqute.eu/) European H2020 project.

**XMC** is **free** under BSD-4 license.

## Main Features
The algorithms **XMC** can run include:
- Monte Carlo,
- Multilevel Monte Carlo,
- Continuation Multilevel Monte Carlo,
- Asynchronous Monte Carlo and Multilevel Monte Carlo.

## Documentation and Usage
Documentation can be found in the form of Docstrings in the code and [here](http://exaqute.eu/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/M12_ExaQUte_deliverable_5.2_Release_of_ExaQUte-MLMC_Python_engine.pdf).
Some examples and validation benchmarks can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/RiccardoRossi/exaqute-xmc/-/tree/development/examples/).

## Dependencies
- NumPy;
