## CoSimulation Application

The CoSimulation Application contains the core developments in coupling black-box solvers within Kratos Multiphysics.

### Features:

- Coupling (weak / strong)

- Various features avaiable for CoSimulation
    - Convergence Accelerators
    - Convergence Criteria
    - Predictors

- Support for MPI parallelization (if invoved solvers support it)

- Coupling of Kratos <=> Kratos without overhead
