# CoSimIO

The _CoSimIO_ is a small library for interprocess communication in CoSimulation contexts. It is designed for exchanging data between different solvers or other software-tools. For performing coupled simulations it is used in combination with the [_CoSimulationApplication_](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/tree/master/applications/CoSimulationApplication).\
It is implemented as a _detached interface_. This means that it follows the interface of Kratos but is independent of Kratos, which allows for an easy integration into other codes / solvers

The implementation is defined in [co_sim_io](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/CoSimIO/blob/master/co_sim_io)

Documentation and tutorials can be found [here](https://kratosmultiphysics.github.io/CoSimIO/)

The tests are contained in [tests](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/CoSimIO/blob/master/tests)

The [changelog](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/CoSimIO/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) contains information about relevant changes in the different versions.

## Dependencies
- The _CoSimIO_ is implemented as a standalone tool in C++. The only dependency is C++11. This includes most of the major C++ compilers in Windows, Linux, and Mac. A detailed list of C++11 compatible compilers [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support#cpp11).
- Dependency on Kratos: There is **NO** dependency on Kratos. The _CoSimIO_ can be used completely without including or linking against Kratos.

## Available languages
Besides the native C++ interface, the _CoSimIO_ also provides interfaces to other languages. Currently the following languages are supported:
- C
- Python

These interfaces are implemented as consistent as possible with the C++ interface.

## Usage
This section provides a brief overview on how to use the _CoSimIO_. For more detailed explanations please check the [documentation](https://kratosmultiphysics.github.io/CoSimIO/) in the corresponding language.

### **C++**
The C++ interface is defined in [co_sim_io.hpp](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/CoSimIO/blob/master/co_sim_io/co_sim_io.hpp). In addition to including this header it is required to compile _CoSimIO_ into a shared library and link against it.

### **C**
The C interface is defined in [co_sim_io_c.h](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/CoSimIO/blob/master/co_sim_io/c/co_sim_io_c.h). In addition to including this header it is required to compile _CoSimIO_ into a shared library and link against it.

### **Python**
The Python interface is defined in [_CoSimIO_ python module](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/CoSimIO/blob/master/co_sim_io/python/co_sim_io_python.cpp). The [pybind library](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) is used for the Python exposure of the C++ interface.

## Parallelism
The _CoSimIO_ supports pure sequential and mpi-parallel executions. Shared memory parallelism is currently not planned but might be added at a later stage.

## Memory Management
Coupling requires frequent exchange of data. Therefore the _CoSimIO_ uses the memory provided by the including solvers/software-tools directly, without copying it to an auxiliar data structure.
