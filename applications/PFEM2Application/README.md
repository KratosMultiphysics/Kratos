## PFEM2 Application

The PFEM2 Application is an operator-splitting based semi-Lagrangian strategy for the solution of the incompressible, Newtonion fluid flow in the laminar regime.

### Features:

- Semi-lagrangian nature makes it possible to use larger time-steps.

- Useful in multi-phase flow simulations.

- Current version is capable of capturing the weak discontinuities in the pressure field.

- New Nitsche-based version will be capable of capturing weak and strong discontinuities in the pressure and velocity field (soon to be added).
