This document aims at documenting MORSE find_package CMake modules
which allow to detect library dependencies on UNIX systems (mainly
Linux and MAC OS X). These additional modules have been written
because either, they are not distributed by the CMake community, or,
they already exist but some are outdated or miss the requirements we
need.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> CMake find modules: what is it, why is it useful?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
The CMake modules being here can be used to "find" some installed
libraries on the system through the invocation of the <code>find_package</code>
CMake command ("MODULE" mode signature, cf. CMake documentation of
<code>find_package</code> command)
</p>
<pre class="example">
find_package(BLAS) # look for BLAS libraries and compiler/linker flags
add_executable(foo ${FOO_SOURCES}) # define an executable from sources
target_link_libraries(foo ${BLAS_LIBRARIES}) # add BLAS libraries for the link
</pre>

<p>
It allows to find efficiently the libraries we depend on.
The modules are generally written by the library developers or very
active users so that they know very well how the library is built how
it is installed, etc.
</p>

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> How CMake is aware of these specific modules?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
<code>find_package(LIBNAME)</code> rely on a CMake module file called
<i>FindLIBNAME.cmake</i> which should lies in a directory set in the CMake
variable <code>CMAKE_MODULE_PATH</code>. For example, <code>FindLIBNAME.cmake</code> is in the
relative path <code>./cmake_modules/FindLIBNAME.cmake</code>
</p>
<pre class="example">
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake_modules")
find_package(LIBNAME)
</pre>

<p>
To use MORSE modules you can add the path to the modules in your CMake
project like this
</p>
<pre class="example">
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${MORSE_DISTRIB_DIR}/cmake_modules/morse/find" )
</pre>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Internal mechanism: what a "find" mainly do, what are the paths scanned?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The general process consists in looking into some system paths known
from CMake to find headers and libraries and define in output some
CMake variables the user need to link with his dependency. Additionaly
to the system paths, some environment variable can also be scanned
like <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> and <code>CPATH</code>. A custom CMake cache variable
<code>LIBNAME_DIR</code> is also introduced in our modules in order to let users
indicate directly during the "configure" step a specific installation
directory for the library (e.g. where are located the include/, lib/,
etc, sub-directories). The priority order is the following:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The CMake variable <code>LIBNAME_DIR</code> is set or both <code>LIBNAME_INCDIR</code> and
<code>LIBNAME_LIBDIR</code> are set
</li>
<li>The environment variable <code>LIBNAME_DIR</code> is set or both <code>LIBNAME_INCDIR</code> and
<code>LIBNAME_LIBDIR</code>
</li>
<li>A pkg-config .pc file (hwloc.pc) of the library is available in the
environment (cf. PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable) and is used
</li>
<li>Look into the following paths
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>for headers:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>scan the paths present in the following environment variables
<code>INCLUDE</code>, <code>C_INCLUDE_PATH</code>, <code>CPATH</code>, <code>INCLUDE_PATH</code>
</li>
<li>scan the system paths for headers: look into path present in
the CMake variable
<code>CMAKE_C_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>for libraries:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>scan the paths present in the following environment variables
<code>LIB</code> (Windows), <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> (Mac OS X), <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> (Linux)
</li>
<li>scan the system paths for headers: look into path present in
the CMake variable
<code>CMAKE_C_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
When it is possible, compiler flags are also given to users. This last
point suggest that the information can be found in the library
installation, e.g. through a pkg-config file.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, the library can be searched for a specific
configuration, e.g "I want to find an installation of this library
coming with all these components enabled" such as: MUMPS linear solver
must be able to use SCOTCH graph partitioner. See the "COMPONENTS"
option of the <code>find_package</code> command and look for the header of the
module file to get more information about possible components.
</p>

<p>
Once some header files and libraries have been found the module tries
to call a basic function of the library to test the link step. During
this process, the CMake <code>check_function_exists</code> is used. If the test
fails a message is given with the compiler and linker flags used
during the test. The precise error can also be found in the
<code>CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log</code> file of the build directory.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-3-1"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> How to act on the searching process?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
If the user does not change the environment (do not modify environment
variables like <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>), and gives no hint at all about the
location of the libraries, the module will match the situation 4.2 and
will look into system paths.
</p>

<p>
To give an "exotic" locations, i.e. not in system paths, the user can
use scripts or a <code>module</code> like system to set the paths in environment
variables (<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, <code>INCLUDE</code>, &#x2026;), cf. situation 4.1 and 2.
</p>

<p>
For some libraries it is possible to rely on <code>pkg-config</code> if the .pc
file path is in the <code>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</code> environment variable,
cf. situation 3.
</p>

<p>
Finally, to directly give "by hand" the path, the user can set a CMake
variable <code>LIBNAME_DIR</code>, or the pair <code>LIBNAME_INCDIR</code> and <code>LIBNAME_LIBDIR</code>,
cf. situation 1.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
If a first configuration has found a library somewhere but you are not
satisfied with this one and want to give some hints to look for it:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>update your environment or give the location "by hand" (<code>LIBNAME_DIR</code>)
</li>
<li>delete the CMake cache file to make it "forget" the libraries
already found: <code>rm CMakeCache.txt</code>
</li>
<li>configure again: <code>cmake path/to/your/CMakeLists.txt ...</code>

the head of the module file. The usage, the optional parameters that
can be used and the output variables are explained here.
