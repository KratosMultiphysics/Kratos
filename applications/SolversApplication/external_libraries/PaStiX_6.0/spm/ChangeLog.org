* SParse Matrix package
** Version 0.1.0
  - First release of the SpM library
  - Multiple drivers to read sparse matrix files (RSA, Harwell-Boeing, IJV,
    Laplacian generators, ...)
  - Basic BLAS/Lapack operations (spmv, spmm, spnorm, ...) to
    manipulate sparse matrices sequential
  - Set of test functions to validate sparse solvers: generate
    random right hand side or x vector, and check for forward and
    backward norms with LAPACK checks.
