 *
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * pzgssvx() solves the system of linear equations A*X=B or A'*X=B, using
 * the LU factorization from zgstrf(). Error bounds on the solution and
 * a condition estimate are also provided. It performs the following steps:
 *
 * 1. If A is stored column-wise (A->Stype = NC):
 *  
 *    1.1. If fact = EQUILIBRATE, scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
 *         the system:
 *           trans = NOTRANS: diag(R)*A*diag(C)*inv(diag(C))*X = diag(R)*B
 *           trans = TRANS:  (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**T *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
 *           trans = CONJ:   (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**H *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
 *         Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
 *         scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
 *         overwritten by diag(R)*A*diag(C) and B by diag(R)*B 
 *         (if trans = NOTRANS) or diag(C)*B (if trans = TRANS or CONJ).
 *
 *    1.2. Permute columns of A, forming A*Pc, where Pc is a permutation matrix
 *         that usually preserves sparsity.
 *         For more details of this step, see zsp_colorder.c.
 *
 *    1.3. If fact = DOFACT or EQUILIBRATE, the LU decomposition is used to 
 *         factor the matrix A (after equilibration if fact = EQUILIBRATE) as
 *         Pr*A*Pc = L*U, with Pr determined by partial pivoting.
 *
 *    1.4. Compute the reciprocal pivot growth factor.
 *
 *    1.5. If some U(i,i) = 0, so that U is exactly singular, then the routine
 *         returns with info = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used to
 *         estimate the condition number of the matrix A. If the reciprocal of
 *         the condition number is less than machine precision, 
 *         info = A->ncol+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still
 *         goes on to solve for X and computes error bounds as described below.
 *
 *    1.6. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
 *         of A.
 *
 *    1.7. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
 *         matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
 *         for it.
 *
 *    1.8. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
 *         diag(C) (if trans = NOTRANS) or diag(R) (if trans = TRANS or CONJ)
 *         so that it solves the original system before equilibration.
 *
 * 2. If A is stored row-wise (A->Stype = NR), apply the above algorithm
 *    to the tranpose of A:
 *
 *    2.1. If fact = EQUILIBRATE, scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
 *         the system:
 *           trans = NOTRANS:diag(R)*A'*diag(C)*inv(diag(C))*X = diag(R)*B
 *           trans = TRANS: (diag(R)*A'*diag(C))**T *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
 *           trans = CONJ:  (diag(R)*A'*diag(C))**H *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
 *         Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
 *         scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A' is
 *         overwritten by diag(R)*A'*diag(C) and B by diag(R)*B 
 *         (if trans = NOTRANS) or diag(C)*B (if trans = TRANS or CONJ).
 *
 *    2.2. Permute columns of transpose(A) (rows of A), 
 *         forming transpose(A)*Pc, where Pc is a permutation matrix that
 *         usually preserves sparsity.
 *         For more details of this step, see zsp_colorder.c.
 *
 *    2.3. If fact = DOFACT or EQUILIBRATE, the LU decomposition is used to 
 *         factor the matrix A (after equilibration if fact = EQUILIBRATE) as
 *         Pr*transpose(A)*Pc = L*U, with the permutation Pr determined by
 *         partial pivoting.
 *
 *    2.4. Compute the reciprocal pivot growth factor.
 *
 *    2.5. If some U(i,i) = 0, so that U is exactly singular, then the routine
 *         returns with info = i. Otherwise, the factored form of transpose(A)
 *         is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.
 *         If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
 *         precision, info = A->nrow+1 is returned as a warning, but the
 *         routine still goes on to solve for X and computes error bounds
 *         as described below.
 *
 *    2.6. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
 *         of transpose(A).
 *
 *    2.7. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
 *         matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
 *         for it.
 *
 *    2.8. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
 *         diag(C) (if trans = NOTRANS) or diag(R) (if trans = TRANS or CONJ)
 *         so that it solves the original system before equilibration.

 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * nprocs (input) int_t
 *         Number of processes (or threads) to be spawned and used to perform
 *         the LU factorization by pzgstrf(). There is a single thread of
 *         control to call pzgstrf(), and all threads spawned by pzgstrf() 
 *         are terminated before returning from pzgstrf().
 *
 * superlumt_options (input) superlumt_options_t*
 *         The structure defines the input parameters and data structure
 *         to control how the LU factorization will be performed.
 *         The following fields should be defined for this structure:
 *
 *         o fact (fact_t)
 *           Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix
 *           A is supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should
 *           be equilibrated before it is factored.
 *           = DOFACT: The matrix A will be factored, and the factors will be
 *             stored in L and U.
 *           = EQUILIBRATE: The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary,
 *             then factored into L and U.
 *           = FACTORED: On entry, L, U, perm_r and perm_c contain the 
 *             factored form of A. If equed is not NOEQUIL, the matrix A has
 *             been equilibrated with scaling factors R and C.
 *             A, L, U, perm_r are not modified.
 *
 *         o trans (trans_t)
 *           Specifies the form of the system of equations:
 *           = NOTRANS: A * X = B        (No transpose)
 *           = TRANS:   A**T * X = B     (Transpose)
 *           = CONJ:    A**H * X = B     (Transpose)
 *
 *         o refact (yes_no_t)
 *           Specifies whether this is first time or subsequent factorization.
 *           = NO:  this factorization is treated as the first one;
 *           = YES: it means that a factorization was performed prior to this
 *               one. Therefore, this factorization will re-use some
 *               existing data structures, such as L and U storage, column
 *               elimination tree, and the symbolic information of the
 *               Householder matrix.
 *
 *         o panel_size (int_t)
 *           A panel consists of at most panel_size consecutive columns.
 *
 *         o relax (int_t)
 *           To control degree of relaxing supernodes. If the number
 *           of nodes (columns) in a subtree of the elimination tree is less
 *           than relax, this subtree is considered as one supernode,
 *           regardless of the row structures of those columns.
 *
 *         o diag_pivot_thresh (double)
 *           Diagonal pivoting threshold. At step j of the Gaussian 
 *           elimination, if 
 *               abs(A_jj) >= diag_pivot_thresh * (max_(i>=j) abs(A_ij)),
 *           use A_jj as pivot, else use A_ij with maximum magnitude. 
 *           0 <= diag_pivot_thresh <= 1. The default value is 1, 
 *           corresponding to partial pivoting.
 *
 *         o usepr (yes_no_t)
 *           Whether the pivoting will use perm_r specified by the user.
 *           = YES: use perm_r; perm_r is input, unchanged on exit.
 *           = NO:  perm_r is determined by partial pivoting, and is output.
 *
 *         o drop_tol (double) (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
 *	     Drop tolerance parameter. At step j of the Gaussian elimination,
 *           if abs(A_ij)/(max_i abs(A_ij)) < drop_tol, drop entry A_ij.
 *           0 <= drop_tol <= 1. The default value of drop_tol is 0,
 *           corresponding to not dropping any entry.
 *
 *         o work (void*) of size lwork
 *           User-supplied work space and space for the output data structures.
 *           Not referenced if lwork = 0;
 *
 *         o lwork (int_t)
 *           Specifies the length of work array.
 *           = 0:  allocate space internally by system malloc;
 *           > 0:  use user-supplied work array of length lwork in bytes,
 *                 returns error if space runs out.
 *           = -1: the routine guesses the amount of space needed without
 *                 performing the factorization, and returns it in
 *                 superlu_memusage->total_needed; no other side effects.
 *
 *    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *    ** The following 3 arrays must be allocated before calling this routine.
 *    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *         o etree  (int*)
 *           Elimination tree of A'*A, dimension A->ncol.
 *
 *         o colcnt_h (int*)
 *           Column colunts of the Householder matrix.
 *
 *         o part_super_h (int*)
 *           Partition of the supernodes in the Householder matrix.
 *	     part_super_h[k] = size of the supernode beginning at column k;
 * 	                     = 0, elsewhere.
 *
 * A       (input/output) SuperMatrix*
 *         Matrix A in A*X=B, of dimension (A->nrow, A->ncol), where
 *         A->nrow = A->ncol. Currently, the type of A can be:
 *         Stype = NC or NR, Dtype = _D, Mtype = GE. In the future,
 *         more general A will be handled.
 *
 *         On entry, If superlumt_options->fact = FACTORED and equed is not 
 *         NOEQUIL, then A must have been equilibrated by the scaling factors
 *         in R and/or C.  On exit, A is not modified 
 *         if superlumt_options->fact = FACTORED or DOFACT, or 
 *         if superlumt_options->fact = EQUILIBRATE and equed = NOEQUIL.
 *
 *         On exit, if superlumt_options->fact = EQUILIBRATE and equed is not
 *         NOEQUIL, A is scaled as follows:
 *         If A->Stype = NC:
 *           equed = ROW:  A := diag(R) * A
 *           equed = COL:  A := A * diag(C)
 *           equed = BOTH: A := diag(R) * A * diag(C).
 *         If A->Stype = NR:
 *           equed = ROW:  transpose(A) := diag(R) * transpose(A)
 *           equed = COL:  transpose(A) := transpose(A) * diag(C)
 *           equed = BOTH: transpose(A) := diag(R) * transpose(A) * diag(C).
 *
 * perm_c  (input/output) int_t*
 *	   If A->Stype = NC, Column permutation vector of size A->ncol,
 *         which defines the permutation matrix Pc; perm_c[i] = j means
 *         column i of A is in position j in A*Pc.
 *         On exit, perm_c may be overwritten by the product of the input
 *         perm_c and a permutation that postorders the elimination tree
 *         of Pc'*A'*A*Pc; perm_c is not changed if the elimination tree
 *         is already in postorder.
 *
 *         If A->Stype = NR, column permutation vector of size A->nrow,
 *         which describes permutation of columns of tranpose(A) 
 *         (rows of A) as described above.
 * 
 * perm_r  (input/output) int_t*
 *         If A->Stype = NC, row permutation vector of size A->nrow, 
 *         which defines the permutation matrix Pr, and is determined
 *         by partial pivoting.  perm_r[i] = j means row i of A is in 
 *         position j in Pr*A.
 *
 *         If A->Stype = NR, permutation vector of size A->ncol, which
 *         determines permutation of rows of transpose(A)
 *         (columns of A) as described above.
 *
 *         If superlumt_options->usepr = NO, perm_r is output argument;
 *         If superlumt_options->usepr = YES, the pivoting routine will try 
 *            to use the input perm_r, unless a certain threshold criterion
 *            is violated. In that case, perm_r is overwritten by a new
 *            permutation determined by partial pivoting or diagonal 
 *            threshold pivoting.
 * 
 * equed   (input/output) equed_t*
 *         Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
 *         = NOEQUIL: No equilibration.
 *         = ROW:  Row equilibration, i.e., A was premultiplied by diag(R).
 *         = COL:  Column equilibration, i.e., A was postmultiplied by diag(C).
 *         = BOTH: Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A was replaced 
 *                 by diag(R)*A*diag(C).
 *         If superlumt_options->fact = FACTORED, equed is an input argument, 
 *         otherwise it is an output argument.
 *
 * R       (input/output) double*, dimension (A->nrow)
 *         The row scale factors for A or transpose(A).
 *         If equed = ROW or BOTH, A (if A->Stype = NC) or transpose(A)
 *            (if A->Stype = NR) is multiplied on the left by diag(R).
 *         If equed = NOEQUIL or COL, R is not accessed.
 *         If fact = FACTORED, R is an input argument; otherwise, R is output.
 *         If fact = FACTORED and equed = ROW or BOTH, each element of R must
 *            be positive.
 * 
 * C       (input/output) double*, dimension (A->ncol)
 *         The column scale factors for A or transpose(A).
 *         If equed = COL or BOTH, A (if A->Stype = NC) or trnspose(A)
 *            (if A->Stype = NR) is multiplied on the right by diag(C).
 *         If equed = NOEQUIL or ROW, C is not accessed.
 *         If fact = FACTORED, C is an input argument; otherwise, C is output.
 *         If fact = FACTORED and equed = COL or BOTH, each element of C must
 *            be positive.
 *         
 * L       (output) SuperMatrix*
 *	   The factor L from the factorization
 *             Pr*A*Pc=L*U              (if A->Stype = NC) or
 *             Pr*transpose(A)*Pc=L*U   (if A->Stype = NR).
 *         Uses compressed row subscripts storage for supernodes, i.e.,
 *         L has types: Stype = SCP, Dtype = _D, Mtype = TRLU.
 *
 * U       (output) SuperMatrix*
 *	   The factor U from the factorization
 *             Pr*A*Pc=L*U              (if A->Stype = NC) or
 *             Pr*transpose(A)*Pc=L*U   (if A->Stype = NR).
 *         Uses column-wise storage scheme, i.e., U has types:
 *         Stype = NCP, Dtype = _D, Mtype = TRU.
 *
 * B       (input/output) SuperMatrix*
 *         B has types: Stype = DN, Dtype = _D, Mtype = GE.
 *         On entry, the right hand side matrix.
 *         On exit,
 *            if equed = NOEQUIL, B is not modified; otherwise
 *            if A->Stype = NC:
 *               if trans = NOTRANS and equed = ROW or BOTH, B is overwritten
 *                  by diag(R)*B;
 *               if trans = TRANS or CONJ and equed = COL of BOTH, B is
 *                  overwritten by diag(C)*B;
 *            if A->Stype = NR:
 *               if trans = NOTRANS and equed = COL or BOTH, B is overwritten
 *                  by diag(C)*B;
 *               if trans = TRANS or CONJ and equed = ROW of BOTH, B is
 *                  overwritten by diag(R)*B.
 *
 * X       (output) SuperMatrix*
 *         X has types: Stype = DN, Dtype = _D, Mtype = GE. 
 *         If info = 0 or info = A->ncol+1, X contains the solution matrix
 *         to the original system of equations. Note that A and B are modified
 *         on exit if equed is not NOEQUIL, and the solution to the 
 *         equilibrated system is inv(diag(C))*X if trans = NOTRANS and
 *         equed = COL or BOTH, or inv(diag(R))*X if trans = TRANS or CONJ
 *         and equed = ROW or BOTH.
 *
 * recip_pivot_growth (output) double*
 *         The reciprocal pivot growth factor computed as
 *             max_j ( max_i(abs(A_ij)) / max_i(abs(U_ij)) ).
 *         If recip_pivot_growth is much less than 1, the stability of the
 *         LU factorization could be poor.
 *
 * rcond   (output) double*
 *         The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix A
 *         after equilibration (if done). If rcond is less than the machine
 *         precision (in particular, if rcond = 0), the matrix is singular
 *         to working precision. This condition is indicated by a return
 *         code of info > 0.
 *
 * ferr    (output) double*, dimension (B->ncol)   
 *         The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector   
 *         X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).   
 *         If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j) 
 *         is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest 
 *         element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the   
 *         largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as   
 *         the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight   
 *         overestimate of the true error.
 *
 * berr    (output) double*, dimension (B->ncol)
 *         The componentwise relative backward error of each solution   
 *         vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in   
 *         any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
 *
 * superlu_memusage (output) superlu_memusage_t*
 *         Record the memory usage statistics, consisting of following fields:
 *         - for_lu (float)
 *           The amount of space used in bytes for L\U data structures.
 *         - total_needed (float)
 *           The amount of space needed in bytes to perform factorization.
 *         - expansions (int_t)
 *           The number of memory expansions during the LU factorization.
 *
 * info    (output) int_t*
 *         = 0: successful exit   
 *         < 0: if info = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value   
 *         > 0: if info = i, and i is   
 *              <= A->ncol: U(i,i) is exactly zero. The factorization has   
 *                    been completed, but the factor U is exactly   
 *                    singular, so the solution and error bounds   
 *                    could not be computed.   
 *              = A->ncol+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
 *                    precision, meaning that the matrix is singular to
 *                    working precision. Nevertheless, the solution and
