## Shallow water application

This is a research application that provides a set of tools for oceanographic and hydrographic simulations over shallow domains. The background of the stabilization method is explained in [^1].

### Dependencies

This application does not have other application dependencies at compile time. The following Python libraries may be required:
  - `scipy` is used by the wave generator and by the benchmarks
  - `numpy` is used to generate solitary waves and analytical solutions by the benchmarks

If the coupling with the Navier-Stokes equations is required [^2], add the following applications to compilation:
  - [HDF5Application](../HDF5Application/README.md)
  - [MappingApplication](../MappingApplication/README.md)
  - [PfemFluidDynamicsApplication](../PfemFluidDynamicsApplication/README.md)
