## Fluid-Structure Interaction Application

The Fluid-Structure Interaction Application contains the core developments in Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) within Kratos Multiphysics.

### Features:

- Partitioned relaxation and Quasi-Newton coupling schemes.

- Support for MPI parallelization (with Trilinos Application).

- Non-matching meshes support (see MappingApplication).

- Laplacian and structural mesh solvers (see MeshMovingApplication).
