## Poromechanics Application

The Poromechanics Application contains developments in coupled solid-pore fluid interaction problems within Kratos Multiphysics.

### Features:

- UPl small displacement element for saturated porous media (with
equal order interpolation, unstable under incompressible-undrained
conditions)

- Stable UPl small displacement element for saturated porous media
(with higher order interpolation for displacements)

- FIC-Stabilized UPl small displacement element for saturated porous media
(with equal order interpolation for displacements)

- UPl Quasi-zero-thickness interface elements for defining cracks and
joints

- Local linear elastic damage model (Simo-Ju and modified Von Mises)

- Non-local linear elastic damage model (Simo-Ju and modified Von
Mises)

- Bilinear cohesive fracture model (for quasi-zero-thickness interface elements)

- Fracture propagation utility based on the combination of the
damage model with the insertion of interface elements after remeshing
with GiD
