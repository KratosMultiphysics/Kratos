     * @brief Get Newly Created or Existing Model Parts List With Common Reference Entities Between Reference List And Examined List
     *
     * This method returns newly created or gets an existing sub-model part in each model part in rReferenceModelParts with entities
     * common between that model part and all the model parts in rExaminedModelPartsList with following
     * entities.
     *      1. If AreNodesConsidered is made to true, then common nodes are found and added to the resulting
     *         sub-model part.
     *      2. If AreConditionsConsidered is made to true, then common conditions are found and added to the resulting
     *         sub-model part. All the nodes belonging to added conditions are also added to the sub-model part.
     *      3. If AreElementsConsidered is made to true, then common elements are found and added to the resulting
     *         sub-model part. All the nodes belonging to added elements are also added to the sub-model part.
     *      4. If AreNeighboursConsidered is made to true, then first common nodes are found. Then neighbour conditions (if AreConditionsConsidered is
     *         set to true) and elements (if AreElementsConsidered is set to true) for those common nodes are found and
     *         added to the sub-model part. All nodes belonging to added conditions and elements are also added to the sub-model part.
     *
     * The created sub-model part is only populated with the entities from the refrence model part. Hence, to find common
     * conditions and elements, each entity from each model part in rExaminedModelPartsList is searched within each of the
     * model parts in rReferenceModelParts.
     *
     * This method creates the sub-model parts with unique name generated for all the input arguments. If it finds an existing
     * sub-model part with the same name, then it is retrieved. Hence this method only creates these model parts with expensive operations
     * only one. If it is required to force create, then the sub-model parts should be removed. All the sub-model parts created
     * by this method have names starting with "<OPTIMIZATION_APP_AUTO>" so it is easier to search and remove them if required.
     *
     * This method keeps the communicator types, process info, properties and tables as same as the rReferenceModelParts.
     * The local mesh, interface mesh and ghost meshes are properly updated. Hence this method is compatible with OpenMP
     * and MPI.
     *
     * This method does not create or destroy nodes, conditions and elements.
     *
     * @param rExaminedModelPartsList       List of input model parts where the entities are searched between.
     * @param rReferenceModelParts          List of reference model parts where common entities are added to output model parts.
     * @param AreNodesConsidered            If true, common nodes from reference model parts are added to output model parts.
     * @param AreConditionsConsidered       If true, common conditions from reference model parts are added to output model parts.
     * @param AreElementsConsidered         If true, common elements from reference model parts are added to output model parts.
     * @param AreNeighboursConsidered       If true, neighbour conditions and elements from reference model parts for common nodes are added to output model parts.
     * @param EchoLevel                     Echo level for printing info.
     * @return std::vector<ModelPart*>      List of output model parts.
