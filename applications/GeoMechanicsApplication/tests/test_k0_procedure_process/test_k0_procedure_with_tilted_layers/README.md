# Test K<sub>0</sub> procedure with tilted layers

**Author:** [Anne van de Graaf](https://github.com/avdg81)

## Case Specification
A test for the K<sub>0</sub> procedure process.  The plane strain model consists of three tilted soil layers.  The phreatic line is located at y = 0.0.  Each soil layer has a linear elastic constitutive law associated with it.

The aim of the test is to verify that the computed effective stress distribution matches the one obtained with Plaxis.
