# c-$\phi$ reduction process

c-$\phi$ reduction process is tested here. This test allows one ot perform a real computation. 
However, the end time is decreased and tollerances are increased to perform just a few steps. 
This is done to have enough data to verify the implemented process and do not over-spend CPU resources. 

## Setup

-  Young’s modulus 14.0 $MPa$
-  Poisson’s ratio 0.3
-  Unit weight 20 $kN/m^3$
-  Cohesion 10 $kPa$
-  Friction angle 35.0 deg
