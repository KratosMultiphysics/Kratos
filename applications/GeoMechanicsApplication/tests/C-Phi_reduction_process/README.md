# $c-\phi$ reduction process

$c-\phi$ reduction process is tested here. This test allows one to perform a real 2D computation. 
However, the end time is decreased and tolerances are increased to perform just a few steps. 
This is done to have enough data to verify the implemented process and do not over-spend CPU resources. 

## Setup
This test consists of 553 6-noded elements (using the UPwSmallStrainElement2D6N class). These elements are shown in the figure below:

The following constraints are applied. 
- The bottom nodes are fixed completely and 
- The nodes on left and right vertical boundaries are allowed to move in the vertical direction only. 

The gravitation acts down in the vertical direction. 

The material is described using:

-  Young’s modulus 14.0 $MPa$
-  Poisson’s ratio 0.3
-  Unit weight 20 $kN/m^3$
-  Cohesion 10 $kPa$
-  Friction angle 35.0 deg
 
The computation is done in two stages. The first stage is a settlement due to the gravitation and it uses K0 procedure. 
The second stage is $c-\phi$ reduction process and it done only for two time steps. The figure below shows the calculated deformation.

## Assertions

The test asserts movement in the horizontal direction at three nodes, which are chosen because their movement is larger than the movement for the majority of nodes.
