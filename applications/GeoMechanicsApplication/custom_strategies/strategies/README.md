## Algorithm

The algorithm is implemented in the FinalizeSolutionStep function that loops over all piping elements until the erosion
growth is finished or all piping elements are checked.

### FinalizeSolutionStep function

![FinalizeSolutionStep.svg](FinalizeSolutionStep.svg)

This function calls other functions that are described below.

### GetPipingElements function

This function returns a list of all piping elements. To create the list, all elements are checked for  
PIPE_START_ELEMENT property that holds Id of the piping starting element.
Then elements on the list are sorted based on X-coordinate of the element begin.
The current limitation is the following. The starting piping element has to have minimum or maximum value of the X
coordinate. This is needed to find a direction for the piping growth.

### InitialiseNumActivePipeElements function

It checks the list of the elements and returns a number of elements with PIPE_ACTIVE property At the beginning the
number is zero.

### CalculateMaxPipeHeight function

It calculates a maximum diameter using CalculateParticleDiameter function then multiplies it by a magic factor of 100 to
get the height value.

### CalculateParticleDiameter

In case of PIPE_MODIFIED_D, the function returns

$$ diameter = factor \Bigg(\frac{D_{70}}{factor}\Bigg)^{0.4}$$

otherwise, $$diameter = D_{70}$$

where \
$D_{70}$ is the particle diameter of 70%-quantile of the grain size distribution by weight [m],\
factor = $2.08\times 10^{-4}$ [m].

### check_pipe_equilibrium function

This function performs an iterative process towards certain equilibrium values of the pipe heights. For each iteration
the modelling is performed. Then a pipe height is corrected by a given increment for each open piping element. The
maximum number of iterations is the user input, "max_piping_iterations".

The typical case is the following. Initially, the equilibrium pipe height is small and quickly the pipe height is
increased above the equilibrium height. At this moment PIPE_EROSION is set to true. Then due to the flow development,
the water pressure gradient decreases, which leads to a higher value of the equilibrium height. As a result the
equilibrium pipe height grows faster than the pipe height. When both of the heights become equal, the iterative process
is stopped.

### Recalculate function

This function performs the modeling using prescribed GeoMechanicsNewtonRaphsonStrategy class.

### CalculateEquilibriumPipeHeight function

This is a function from SteadyStatePwPipingElement. It calculates the equilibrium pipe height as

$$F \frac{\pi }{3} D_p \Big(\frac{\rho_s}{\rho_w} - 1\Big) \eta
\frac{\sin(\theta + \alpha)}{\cos(\theta)  \frac{dh}{dx}}$$

where $F$ is the model factor,\
$D_p$ is the particle diameter calculated with CalculateParticleDiameter function,\
$\rho_s$ is the solid density,\
$\rho_w$ is the water density,\
$\eta$ is the packing coefficient,\
$\theta$ is the angle of repose or bedding angle,\
$\alpha$ is the slope of the pipe,\
$\frac{dh}{dx}$ is the head gradient obtained with CalculateHeadGradient function,\
Currently, the pipe is assumed horizontal $\alpha = 0$.

### check_status_tip_element function

This function checks the open piping elements and if their height is larger than a maximum value of the pipe height or
too small then the function changes the pipe properties: PIPE_EROSION and PIPE_ACTIVE to false. In this case the
function sets grow parameter as false. As well the grow is set to false if all piping elements are open.

### save_or_reset_pipe_heights function

This function sets values of PREV_PIPE_HEIGHT and PIPE_HEIGHT parameters based on 'grow' input value. If grow is equal
to true which means the piping is growing then PREV_PIPE_HEIGHT value is assigned to PIPE_HEIGHT value. If grow is false
then PIPE_HEIGHT value is assigned to the PREV_PIPE_HEIGHT value.

### Interaction with Interface classes.

SteadyStatePwPipingElement class sets JointWidth equal to PIPE_HEIGHT to call functions from Interface classes.
