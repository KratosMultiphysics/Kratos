A staged calculation cannot be calculated via GiD. This has to be done via the command prompt or python.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
	\item Take the template file "MainKratos$\_$multiple$\_$stages$\_$template.py" from ./KratosGeoMechanics/applications/GeoMechanicsApplication. And copy it to the main KratosGeoMechanics directory. Rename the file to "MainKratos.py"
	
	\item right click on "MainKratos.py" and select "edit". 
	\item Edit the project$\_$paths variable such that it refers to the correct *.gid files. Note that the file paths should stay within the quotation marks.
	
	\item In windows explorer, go to the KratosGeoMechanics directory. In the adress-bar, type in: "cmd" and press "enter", such that command prompt is opened while already referring to the correct directory. In the command prompt, type in: "python MainKratos.py". Now the calculation should start running with as many stages as preferred.
