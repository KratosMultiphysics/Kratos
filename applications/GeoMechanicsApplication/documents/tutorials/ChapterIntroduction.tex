%In this manual, it is explained how to use the connection between the \textbf{GID pre/post processor} en the \textbf{DgFlow kernel}. 
%
%\textbf{DgFlow} is a kernel which can be used for groundwater flow calculations, DgFlow separates itself from other groundwater flow software with a piping module to calculate piping related issues. The scientific manual can be found @@@@ 
%
%The \textbf{GID pre/post processor} is used to assign materials, boundary conditions and to create a mesh for DgFlow, both for 2D and 3D geometries. The complete reference manual for GID can be found here: \href{https://www.gidhome.com/documents/referencemanual/Tabla\%20de\%20Contenidos}{GID Reference Manual}.
%
%The connection is made for \textbf{GiD version 13.0.4}, the connection might work for other versions, but this is not validated.\\
