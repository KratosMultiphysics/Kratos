The application includes tests to check the proper functioning of the application
 
### Features: 
 
- Mesh tying conditions based in mortar formulation
 
- Augmented Lagrangian contact conditions based in mortar formulation
 
 	* Frictionless formulation
 	
 	* Frictional formulation (WIP)
 
- Strategies, processes, solvers and convergence criterias used by the contact formulation
 
- The application includes search utilities in order to create the contact conditions
