# MPM Application

This application implements the **Material Point Method (MPM)** with main motivations of simulating non-linear large deformable materials, such as free-surface flows, geomechanical phenomena, and extreme events involving impact, penetration, fragmentation, blast, multi-phase interaction, failure evolution, etc.

## Theory

Particle or meshfree methods are a family of methods in which the state of a system is represented by a set of particles, without a fixed connectivity. As a consequence, these methods are particularly well suited for the analysis of moving discontinuities and large deformations with breaking and fragmentation. This approach does not suffer from the mesh distortion and entanglement issues posed by other Lagrangian discretizations such as the Finite Element Method (FEM).

The **Material Point Method** (MPM) is an hybrid thechnique which uses a fixed background grid (or mesh) for solving the governing equations in a FEM fashion and  set of material particles (MP) for storing all the hystorical variables and material informations. The MPM has gained a remarkably increasing popularity due to its capability in simulating problems involving historically dependent materials and large deformations. As MPM is able to combine the strengths of both Eulerian and Lagrangian methods, it has been used in various engineering applications and industrial purposes, in particular in geomechanics and in the environmental fluid dynamics field.

## Getting Started

The `MPMApplication` is part of the Kratos Multiphysics framework and can be obtained in two different ways:
* by installing the Kratos binaries using the package manager `pip` (suggested for users that want to use the application like a black-box);
* by downloading the source code and compiling it (suggested for developers).

### Getting Binaries with `pip` (users)

Kratos binaries are available for Linux, Windows and MacOS and can be installed by using the `pip` package manager.

Open the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m pip install KratosMPMApplication
```

This command will install the following packages:
* `KratosMultiphysics`: Kratos Multiphysics Core;
* `KratosMPMApplication`: application implementing MPM;
* `KratosLinearSolversApplication`: dependency required by `MPMApplication`.

### Build from Source (developers)

Instructions on how to download, compile and run Kratos in your local machine for development and testing purposes are available for Linux, Windows and MacOS distributions in the [installation page](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

In particular, in order to use the `MPMApplication` it is also required to compile the auxiliary `LinearSolversApplication`.

* In **Linux**, the following lines must appear in the `/path_to_kratos/scripts/standard_configure.sh` file:
    ```bash
    export KRATOS_APPLICATIONS=
    add_app ${KRATOS_APP_DIR}/MPMApplication
    add_app ${KRATOS_APP_DIR}/LinearSolversApplication
    ```

* In **Windows**, the following lines must appear in the `/path_to_kratos/scripts/standard_configure.sh` file:
    ```console
    set KRATOS_APPLICATIONS=
    CALL :add_app %KRATOS_APP_DIR%\MPMApplication;
    CALL :add_app %KRATOS_APP_DIR%\LinearSolversApplication;
    ```

## GUI

A GUI (Graphic User Interface) for the MPM application is also available within the pre and post processing software [GiD](https://www.gidhome.com/). Instructions on how to download and install it are available in the [`GiDInterface` repository](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/GiDInterface/tree/master/). A basic knowledge of GiD is required.

Any software able to handle `vtk` files can be used for post processing (e.g., `Paraview`).

## Examples & Tutorials
* Use-cases and validation examples are available in the MPM section of the [Examples repository](https://kratosmultiphysics.github.io/Examples/).
* Unit tests of the main features can be found in the [tests](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/tree/master/applications/MPMApplication/tests) folder.
* A step-by-step tutorial using GiD for both pre and post processing is available [here](https://kratosmultiphysics.github.io/Kratos/pages/Applications/MPM_Application/MPM_example_in_GiD/introduction.html).
