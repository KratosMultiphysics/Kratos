## MeshMoving Application

The MeshMoving Application (formerly ALEapplication) contains different mesh-update techniques.

A typical application for the use of mesh-moving is in Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) when the fluid mesh is moved after the displacements of the structure are mapped on the interface

### Features:

- laplacian mesh motion solver

- structural similarity mesh motion solver

- computation of mesh velocities (ALE)

- ALE-fluid solver for the usage in FSI

- works both in OpenMP and MPI

### Usage

Check the tests for examples on how to use the solvers.
