## 4. Calculation
By now, the setup of the model of the cantilever is complete. To calculate the displacement of the cantilever, click in the top toolbar on **`Calculate`&rightarrow;`Calculate`**, as shown in the image below.

Then the calculation of the problem is carried out. As already mentioned in the first paragraph, the calculation is done within the [KRATOS Multiphysics](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos) framework. More information on the material point method and its implementation within KRATOS is available under [ParticleMechanicsApplication](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/tree/master/applications/ParticleMechanicsApplication).

After the calculation, one can find in the project folder the following files (among others):

- MainKratos.py
- ProjectParamters.json
- ParticleMaterials.json
- project_name_Body.mdpa
- project_name_Grid.mdpa

- project_name_Body.post.res
- project_name_Grid.post.bin 

The files *MainKratos.py*, *ProjectParamters.json*, *ParticleMaterials.json*, *project_name_Body.mdpa* and *project_name_Grid.mdpa* contain the data  that is required for the calculation of the problem with KRATOS.

The last two files *project_name_Body.post.res* and *project_name_Grid.post.bin* contain essential results of the calculation and are used in the post-processing.
