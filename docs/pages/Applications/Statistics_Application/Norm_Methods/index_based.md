Index based norms are available for both `Vector` and `Matrix` based variable types. `index_i` is used for `Vector` variables, where `i` represents the index of the vector to be used as the scalar representing a corresponding vector. `index_(i,j)` is used for `Matrix` variables, where `i` represents the row index and `j` represents the column index of the matrix value which to be used as the scalar representation of the given matrix.
