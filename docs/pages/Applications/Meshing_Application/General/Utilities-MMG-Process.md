# What is MMG? 

*MMG* is an open source software for simplicial remeshing. [*MMG* main page](http://www.mmgtools.org/ ), and you can download the code in [GitHub](https://github.com/MmgTools/mmg).

* It provides 3 applications and 4 libraries:
	*  The `mmg2d` application and the `libmmg2d` library: adaptation and optimization of a two-dimensional triangulation and generation of a triangulation from a set of points or from given boundary edges
	*  The `mmgs` application and the `libmmgs` library: adaptation and optimization of a surface triangulation and isovalue discretization
	*  The `mmg3d` application and the `libmmg3d` library: adaptation and optimization of a tetrahedral mesh and implicit domain meshing
	*  The `libmmg` library gathering the `libmmg2d`, `libmmgs` and `libmmg3d` libraries

* It uses a [LGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html) license and it has been integrated in *Kratos* via the `mmg_process.h` in the `MeshingApplication`. 
<span style="color:red">Important: For use it you need to download first (look in the installation section)</span>
* It is used like a process, using the `mmg_process.py` in the `MeshingApplication`.
* There are basically two different types of re-meshing strategies (both of them compatibles with an anisotropic re-meshing):
	* `Level-Set`: This re-meshing technique is based in the gradient of the `DISTANCE` function, and can be used to re-mesh when you are getting closer to the reference geometry. 
	* `Hessian`: This re-meshing technique is based in the computation of the Hessian of any variable, in the case of more than one variable or a variable by components is considered them the intersection of the corresponding tensors is computed.

# How can I install this library?


The installation of the library is fortunately quite straightforward thanks to the marvels of the configure scripts. The easiest way is the following one, because requires the minimal effort; of course if you have expertise you can find an alternative way to install the library:

* Go to `MeshingApplication/custom_external_libraries/`
	* Here you can see the `mmg` folder, but it is empty. You have the `README.txt`, where the installation is explained, and the build folder, where the `configure.sh` script can be found.
	* Go to a folder of your chose to install the library (for example `~/src`) (make sure you have installed `git` first):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MmgTools/mmg.git
```

* Then copy the `build` folder from the old `mmg` folder to the new `mmg` folder. Go to the build folder and execute:

Linux
```sh
sh configure.sh
```
Windows
(Command prompt)
```cmd
configure.bat
```
Windows
(Powershell)
```cmd
./configure.bat
```

* Once the compilation is done go to the main *Kratos* folder and go to your `scripts` folder. Here you modify the `configure.sh` or `configure.bat` adding the following lines (modify the `kratos_dir` for your current *Kratos* installation directory): 

```sh
-DINCLUDE_MMG=ON                                                     \
-DMMG_ROOT="/path/to/src/mmg/build"                                         \
```

It will be assumed that the libraries folder is under `/path/to/srtc/mmg/build/lib`. In case your libraries are not detected automatically, you can specify the path by using:
```sh
-DINCLUDE_MMG=ON                                                    \
-DMMG_BUILDDIR="/path/to/src/mmg/build"                             \
-DMMG_LIBDIR="/path/to/custom/mmg/lib"                              \
```


   **In Windows, it is possible that the build  folder was written in your C://Program Files/ folder**

   Further information and possible errors are covered in [this README.](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/blob/master/applications/MeshingApplication/custom_external_libraries/mmg/README.md)
* After that recompile Kratos using again:
Linux
```sh
sh Kratos/scripts/configure.sh
```
Windows
```bat
Kratos/scripts/configure.sh
```

Once Kratos is compiled, you will have to tell the OS where to find the libraries. You can do that by executing this command.

Linux
```bash
echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/my/src/folder/mmg/build/lib" >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

Windows:

If the MMG folder was written to "C://Program Files/" you won't need to add it to the environment variables.

Otherwise:

In a Command Prompt:
```cmd
set PATH=%PATH%;C:/path/to/mmg/libs
```
In Windows Powershell:
```cmd
$Env:PATH+=";C:/path/to/mmg/libs"
```

Or set them permanently using the **Edit the system environment variables option** in the Control panel

# Once it is compiled

Go to the folder tests in the `MeshingApplication` and run:

```sh
python3 test_MeshingApplication.py
```

You should get an OK, if you don't get an OK there is something wrong:

* Check that your compilation is the correct one
	* Follow again all the steps
	* Check that the configure.sh it is correctly compiled
* If you get an `Unexpected error`:
	* This problem is because your machine is not compatible with the library, unfortunately this means that you need to wait until the problem is solved

# How can I use this library?

## Manually

Taking for example the following [mesh](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Examples/tree/master/mmg_remeshing_examples/use_cases/coarse_sphere), and using the following python script (included in the previous compressed file) it is possible to re-mesh a very coarsed mesh of a sphere into a fine an anisotropic sphere.

                        }
                        """)
metric_process = MeshingApplication.ComputeLevelSetSolMetricProcess3D(main_model_part,KratosMultiphysics.DISTANCE_GRADIENT,level_set_param)

gid_output.ExecuteBeforeSolutionLoop()
gid_output.ExecuteInitializeSolutionStep()

```

The metric can be calculated by hand if you prefer, for example to get the same result than the previous script:

UnityVector[1] = 0.0
UnityVector[2] = 0.0

# We set to zero the metric

for node in main_model_part.Nodes:
    # Calculate the element size

    nodal_h = node.GetSolutionStepValue(KratosMultiphysics.NODAL_H, 0)
    element_size = 0.1
    if (abs(distance) > 0.5):
        element_size = nodal_h

    # Calculate anisotropic ratio
    ratio = 1.0
    if (abs(distance) < 0.5):
        ratio = 0.01 + (abs(distance)/0.5) * (1.0 - 0.01);

    # We get the gradient
    gradient_value = UnityVector

    # Finally we calculate the metric
    coeff0 = 1.0/(element_size * element_size);
    coeff1 = coeff0/(ratio * ratio);

    v0v0 = gradient_value[0]*gradient_value[0];
    v0v1 = gradient_value[0]*gradient_value[1];

## Using the process

As said before, the re-meshing is based in a process structure, in this case the 'MainKratos.py' files must be modified (you can take as reference one present in the next section). The parameters that define this process are the following ones:

```json

The meaning of each of the parameters is the following one:

* `output_file_name`: This is the name of `*.sol` and `*.mesh` generated in the case you chose to activate `save_external_files`.
* `model_part_name`: This is important, it should correspond with the name of your actual main model part.
* `strategy`: The type of strategy to chose, or `LevelSet` or `Hessian`.
* If you chose the `LevelSet` strategy:
	* `scalar_variable`:The scalar variable used to calculate the gradient and remesh.
	* `gradient_variable`: The variable where this gradient will be stored.
* If you chose the `Hessian` strategy:
	* `metric_variable`: The list of variables that can be considered to calculate the metrics of re-meshing.
	* `interpolation_error`: The interpolation error considered in the re-mesh.
	* `mesh_dependent_constant`: This value is automatically calculated if set to 0, but many definitions can be found in the literature.
	
* `framework`: Whatever you want to work "fluids" using `Eulerian` or "solids" using `Lagrangian`. If you choose `Lagrangian` you will need to interpolate the internal variables if you are considering any constitutive model with history (damage or plasticity).
	* `bucket_size`: The size of the bucket used in the tree search.
	* `allocation_size`: The maximum size to allocate the GP used in the search.
	* `search_factor`: The factor that will be used to search near GP, will take the radius of the current element and multiply by this factor.
	* `internal_variable_interpolation_list` : The list containing the internal variables that will be interpolated.
	* `interpolation_type`: There are mainly two ways to interpolate the internal variables (there are three, but just two are behave correctly):
			* `CPT`: Closest point transfer. It transfer the values from the closest **GP**
			* `LST`: Least-square projection transfer. It transfers from the closest **GP** from the old mesh
			* `SFT`: It transfer GP values to the nodes in the old mesh and then interpolate to the new mesh using the shape functions all the time (**NOTE**: THIS DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY, AND REQUIRES EXTRA STORE)
* `enforce_current`: If the current size will be enforce as minimum.
* `initial_step`: The first step to consider to count for the re-meshing.
* `step_frequency`: The re-mesh will be performed each this number of steps.
* `automatic_remesh`: If to re-mesh according ratios or manually.
	* `automatic_remesh_type`: If the automatic re-meshed is performed according a ratio or statistically
	* `min_size_ratio`: The proportional ratio of the minimum respect the mean or median `NODAL_H`
	* `max_size_ratio`: The proportional ratio of the maximum respect the mean or median `NODAL_H`
	* `refer_type`: This can be chosen between the mean or the median, the mean is the default value.
	* `min_size_current_percentage`: When the minimum size is defined statistically, this is the minimum size percentile
	* `max_size_current_percentage`: When the maximum size is defined statistically, this is the maximum size percentile
* `advanced_parameters`  : These are advanced *MMG* parameters
	* `force_hausdorff_value`:  If the *Hausdorff* is set. This parameter controls the smoothness of the contour
	* `hausdorff_value`: Global *Hausdorff* value (default value = 0.01) applied on the whole boundary
	* `no_move_mesh`: Avoid/allow point relocation
	* `no_surf_mesh`: Avoid/allow surface modifications
	* `no_insert_mesh`: Don't insert nodes on mesh
	* `no_swap_mesh`: Don't swap mesh
	* `deactivate_detect_angle`: Set the angle detection as activated
	* `force_gradation_value`:  If the gradation of the mesh will be enforced
	* `gradation_value` : Set the gradation
* `initial_remeshing`: If to perform some remeshing in the initialization process
* `fix_contour_model_parts`: This is a list with the submodelparts of the contour where you desire to fix the nodes.
* `fix_conditions_model_parts` : The same, but applied for conditions
* `fix_elements_model_parts` : Idem, but in this case for elements
* `minimal_size`: When the minimum size is specified manually
* `maximal_size`: When the maximum size is specified manually
* `anisotropy_remeshing`: If the anisotropy should be considered in the computation of the remeshing
	* `hmin_over_hmax_anisotropic_ratio`: The minimal anisotropic ratio considered (**NOTE**: 0 is the maximum value of anisotropy, 1  is not anisotropic at all)
	* `boundary_layer_max_distance`: When the threshold value is specified manually
	* `boundary_layer_min_size_ratio`: When the threshold value is specified using a ratio of reference
	* `interpolation`: The interpolation algorithm used in the anisotropic area. By default is linear, which means that is increasing until the value to the reference is zero.
* `save_external_files`: This activates the saving of the resulting meshes (in `*.mesh` and `*.sol` files)
* `max_number_of_searchs`: This is the max. number of search that can be done in the value interpolation process (when values are interpolated from the old mesh to the new mesh)
* `debug_mode`: If true will output a *GiD* file with just after each remesh (could be useful to check if the error is in the generated mesh).
* `echo_level`: This sets the `echo_level`, 0 for no output at all, 3 for standard output.
 
Can you show us a little example? 

Of course, in the [examples repository](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Examples/tree/master/mmg_remeshing_examples) you can find some examples using the process that you can run in your machine. 

[This problem](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Examples/tree/master/mmg_remeshing_examples/use_cases/channel_sphere2D) consists in a 2D fluid problem with continuous re-meshing using the Hessian of the velocity as reference. The resulting output should look something similar to the [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yd57qxtnNFk&feature=youtu.be).

[The same case in 3D](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Examples/tree/master/mmg_remeshing_examples/use_cases/channel_sphere3D). The resulting output should look something similar to the [this](https://youtu.be/HVNa5O6h4wM).
