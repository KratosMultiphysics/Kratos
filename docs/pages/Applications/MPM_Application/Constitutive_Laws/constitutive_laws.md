In this section we discuss the constitutive laws that are implemented in the `MPMApplication` and for each of them we list the variables that must be defined in the `ParticleMaterials.json` file.

## Linear Elasticity

The **linear elastic** constitutive law is identified by the following labels:

- `LinearElasticIsotropicPlaneStrain2DLaw`: two-dimensional problem, plane strain formulation;
- `LinearElasticIsotropicPlaneStress2DLaw`: two-dimensional problem, plane stress formulation;
- `LinearElasticIsotropic3DLaw`: three-dimensional problem.

These are the admissible (string) values that can be assigned to the field `"name"` of the `"constitutive_law"` section in the file `ParticleMaterials.json`.
More details about the input file `ParticleMaterials.json` can be found [here](../Input_Files/json#particlematerialsjson).
