## Overview

The Hitchhiker's Guide provides a valuable resource for student groups involved in the Structural Wind Engineering (SWE) project, assisting them with the technical aspects of the project. The guide is organized in a mostly chronological order, following the project steps. It is recommended to begin by reviewing the Installation Guides to ensure all necessary tools for the project are set up. Additionally, preparations for the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of the case study should be completed, as outlined in the Preprocessing chapter. Once everything is in place, a remote connection to the cluster of the Chair of Structural Analysis is required, as the simulations demand significant computational power. The Remote Computing chapter of the guide will assist with navigating this process. Once the CFD simulation is complete, working with the results is critical. The Postprocessing chapter outlines the necessary steps for extracting relevant information from the results. Alongside the CFD simulation, the wind forces' time series will be exported to a beam model, modeled using the "Parametrical Optimizable Beam" (ParOptBeam) program of the Chair of Structural Analysis, in order to run the Computational Structural Dynamics (CSD) Simulation. The ParOptBeam guide will provide assistance with beam model set up and input/output processes.
