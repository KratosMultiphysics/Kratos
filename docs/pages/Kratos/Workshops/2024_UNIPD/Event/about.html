         The workshop aims to gather researchers and developers, young and senior, both from universities and companies, to discuss the current state of development of the
         <i>Kratos Multiphisics</i> framework. There will be sessions dedicated at showing
         the usage of Kratos in industry, sessions dedicated at showing the capabilities of
         (some of) the Kratos Applications and a session dedicated to the latest advances in
         the <i>Kratos Core</i>.
         </p>

         <p>
         Coffee breaks and a round table session in the afternoon of the second day
         will allow for informal discussions
         among the participants, exchange of ideas and share of expertise, with also the hope
         to foster new research and collaborations among different, yet very close, fields.
         </p>

        <p>
        People without any experience in using Kratos and interested in joining
        the Kratos Multiphysics Community is also
        welcome! Indeed, in this edition of the Kratos Workshop, the last day (November 8, 2024)
        will be entirely dedicated to a <b>Kratos Course</b>. The course will be held by people
        from the <i>Kratos Technical Committee</i> and it has the aim of introducing the basic
        concepts of the "Kratos + GiD enviroment" to newcomers. Material from previous editions
        is available <a href="https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Documentation/tree/master/Workshops_files">here</a>.</p>

        <p>The workshop is <b>free</b>, no fee is required. However, for organization purposes
        we kindly ask you to register as soon as possible.
