# Install 

*Clang-Tidy* is a tool developed and maintained by the *Clang/LLVM* community. The official documentation can be found at [http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/](http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/). When running Linux, *clang-tidy* is usually easy to get via your distributionâ€™s package manager. On Ubuntu Linux:

```sh
sudo apt-get install clang-tidy
```
 
 Additionally you can download directly in the [project page](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html).
 
 # Introduction
 
 A typical invocation of the command-line tool looks like this:
 
 ```sh
 clang-tidy test.cpp -- -Imy_project/include -DMY_DEFINES ...
 ```
 
 Executing it like this, the tool will print a bunch of warnings and notes (if applicable), in exactly the same way Clang/GCC provide diagnostics, too.
 
 The avalaible checkers avaible can be found with the following command:
 
 ```sh
 clang-tidy --list-checks -checks='*' | grep "modernize"
    modernize-avoid-bind
    modernize-deprecated-headers
    modernize-loop-convert
    modernize-make-shared
    modernize-make-unique
    modernize-pass-by-value
    modernize-raw-string-literal
    modernize-redundant-void-arg
    modernize-replace-auto-ptr
    modernize-shrink-to-fit
    modernize-use-auto
    modernize-use-bool-literals
    modernize-use-default
    modernize-use-emplace
    modernize-use-nullptr
    modernize-use-override
    modernize-use-using
 ```
 
 To correct the code we can use the command `-fix` (not all the avalaible checkers have the `-fix` function). For example to add the missing overrides in the following code:
 
 ```c
 struct Base {
    virtual void reimplementMe(int a) {}
};
struct Derived : public Base  {
    virtual void reimplementMe(int a) {}
};
 ```
 
 We use the next command:
 
 ```sh
 clang-tidy -checks='modernize-use-override' -fix test.cpp -- -std=c++11
 ```
 
 # Using to correct a whole project
 
 The previous example will work just with a very simple example contained in one file. To correct the whole project we will need to create a `json` file containing all the file in the project. For that we add the following line to ou configure.sh:
 
 ```sh
 -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON                                                       \
 ```
 
 This will create a file named `compile_commands.json` that we will use with the following python script from the [LLVM project]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KratosMultiphysics/Documentation/master/Resources_files/Clang-tidy%20modernize/run-clang-tidy.py)).
 
 Once we have the script and the json file we can check and fix the whole project by the following way:
 
 ```sh
 run-clang-tidy.py -header-filter='.*' -checks='-*,modernize-use-override' -fix
 ```

You can run simmultaneously all the possible modernize commands using the following [shell script]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KratosMultiphysics/Documentation/master/Resources_files/Clang-tidy%20modernize/modernize.sh).

 ```sh
sh modernize.sh
 ```
