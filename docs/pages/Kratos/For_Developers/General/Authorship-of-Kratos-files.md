The following guidelines defined by the **Technical committee** describe the practices related with the authorship of the files edited by the developers.

- We believe that **someone who contributed a new code feature is the author of that**.

- Anyone modifying/correcting/improving a given feature is understood to be doing for the Kratos's good and wouldn't be considered as author  **unless the original author/s agree about ADDING him as a new author**.
Note that "obvious re-factorings" should NOT be considered as contributions.

- In the case in which the original author is not any longer active then someone __doing significant modifications__ can ADD himself to the list of authors, taking over the responsability of the maintenance of the given file.
