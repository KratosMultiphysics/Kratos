# Introduction

The following tries to be a non-exhaustive list of classes and variables, and their respective methods, accessible via the *Kratos* interface. The objective of this is avoid the need  to look directly on the code to see which methods and classes, and with which name, are exported to the *Python* interface. This will make easier to new (and no so new) users to make contact with the *Kratos* structure and be able to start with the their developments.

This documentation has been created in a semi-automatic way using the `pydoc` utility for python. The script can be found [here](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Documentation/tree/master/Wiki_files/pydoc)

So it just accesses to the public information available via the command `help` on *Python*.
