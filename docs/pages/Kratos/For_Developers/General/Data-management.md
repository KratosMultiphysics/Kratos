## Data management tutorial

In this tutorial will be introduced how manipulating a model from *Python*. Iterating over mesh nodes, elements and conditions. Generating ModelParts and SubModelParts and assigning entities to them.

First we will introduce how to manipulate from scratch in order to understand the basic concepts, then an application case will be used to expand these concepts.

### Some python manipulations from scratch

- [Generating New Modelparts](../../For_Users/Getting_Started/Data_Structure/ModelPart_And_SubModelPart)
- [Entities creation from scratch](../../For_Users/Getting_Started/Data_Structure/Entities_Creation_From_Scratch)

### Considering application case
