In the case you just want to use _Kratos_ just to compute cases, without any modification of the code, the easiest way to install it is considering the binaries available in the [GiD](http://www.gidhome.com/)  pre and post-processor.

In this case the we just go to the download section in the [GiD](http://www.gidhome.com/)  page and go to the download section, as seen in the following image:

Once we are in the download section we select the corresponding stable version to our operative system:

We install the GiD version, and once is installed we initialize the GiD. After activation we select the _Kratos_ problemtype as seen in the following image:

A download menu will appear, we select to download the _Kratos_ problemtype, after installation we will be able to use the _Kratos_ problemtype and compute cases.
