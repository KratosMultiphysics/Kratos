## Technical Committee
The Kratos Technical Committee (TC) is the maximum technical body of the Kratos project. It either acts on its own initiative or by
request of any developer to help on the solution of technical issues or eventually in decision
conflicts. The committee will attempt to find a consensus between the developers. In the case in
which such a consensus cannot be reached, will ultimately take decisions.
The TC will act whenever possible through online communication mechanisms, actively participating
in discussions in which it is directly mentioned. Meetings, either in person or virtual will be organized
as-needed.
The committee has the following composition:
- 2 native members
- 3 elected members
- Members appointed by industrial sponsors

### Native members
The 2 native members are Pooyan Dadvand and Riccardo Rossi due to their long experience since
the beginning of the project. This will help the stability and maintain the accumulated experience in
the committee. This status will hold as long as they are actively contributing to the project. In case
one of the native chairs leaves the position, a new elected member will take his place.
### Elected members
The 3 elected members will be renewed every 2 years.

active more than one year in the repository.
