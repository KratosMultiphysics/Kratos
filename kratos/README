This is a brief note on the installation procedure for the Kratos.

ASSUMPTIONS:
- Python 2.4 is assumed to be preinstalled in the system
- boost_python library is assumed to be precompiled for the current architecture

BASIC IDEAS:
the kratos is divided in three parts: 
1 - kratos -> Static Library -> contains the "base" of the code, database, solvers ...
2 - KratosPython library -> Shared Library -> Contains the interface of the base to the python
3 - Applications -> Shared Libraries -> this is the user defined part, contains the code to tackle the real problems

INSTALLATION
- "Makefile_includes" contains the setting to be used in the installation and SHOULD BE CUSTOMIZED by the user to ensure that the correct directories are used
- the command to install all the kratos, including the applications is 

  make install  

it is possible to compile separately the different parts of the code by typing

  make installkratos
  make installkratospython
  make installapplications

it should be noted that:
kratospython depends on kratos
applications depend on kratos

incremental remake (only recompiles cpp files) can be obtained by typing

	make all

or

	make allkratos
	make allkratospython
	make allapplications



KNOWN "BUGS"
 the installation is known to fail on SUSE10 on a AMD64 architecture. 
 This is due to a compiler error of the gcc 4.0.2 which comes native with the distribution
 the only solution known is to upgrade or downgrade the compiler
