Current directory contains the documentation for the symbolic derivation of the 
"navier_stokes" element, which includes a formulation of a Navier-Stokes element
for both 2D and 3D cases.

running 
python generate_navier_stokes_element.py

a file 
"navier_stokes.cpp" is generated automatically
such file should be copied within the "custom_elements" folder

the corresponding header file "navier_stokes.h", which implements the element is also stored in the custom_elements folder
