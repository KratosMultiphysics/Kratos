		SuperLU EXAMPLES

This directory contains sample programs to illustrate how to use
various functions provded in SuperLU. You can modify these
examples to suit your applications.

Here are the descriptions of the double precision examples:
    dlinsol : use simple driver DGSSV to solve a linear system one time.
    dlinsol1: use simple driver DGSSV in the symmetric mode.
    dlinsolx: use DGSSVX with the full (default) options to solve a
              linear system.
    dlinsolx1: use DGSSVX to factorize A first, then solve the system later.
    dlinsolx2: use DGSSVX to solve systems repeatedly with the same sparsity
	       pattern of matrix A.
    superlu  : the small 5x5 sample program in Section 2 of the Users' Guide.

    ditersol: use GMRES with ILU preconditioner to solver a linear system.
              (The ILU is computed by the routine SRC/dgsitrf.c)


To compile all the examples, type:
	% make

To run the small 5x5 sample program in Section 1 of the Users' Guide, type:
    	% superlu

To run the real version examples, type:
        % dlinsol < g10      (or, % slinsol < g10)
        % dlinsolx -h < g10     (or, % slinsolx < g10)
        % dlinsolx1 < g10    (or, % slinsolx1 < g10)
        % dlinsolx2 < g10    (or, % slinsolx2 < g10)

To run the complex version examples, type:
        % zlinsol < cmat      (or, % clinsol < cmat)
        % zlinsolx < cmat     (or, % clinsolx < cmat)
        % zlinsolx1 < cmat    (or, % clinsolx1 < cmat)
        % zlinsolx2 < cmat    (or, % clinsolx2 < cmat)

To run the ILU preconditioner example, type:
        % ditersol -h < g10
        % zitersol -h < cmat
