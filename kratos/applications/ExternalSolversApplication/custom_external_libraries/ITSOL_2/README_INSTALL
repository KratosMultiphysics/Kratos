|----------------- Iterative Solvers Package --------------------------|
+======================================================================+

This is  part of  the ITSOL extention  to the SPARSKIT  package.  This
particular  sub-package provides  preconditioners for  solving general
sparse * real-valued * linear systems of equations.

Once you have unpacked the tar ball -- go to the ITSOL directory and
edit  the  file 'makefile'  for  customizing  the loaders,  compilers,
compiler flags, etc ... then type

make lib

to create the library libitsol.a

Once this  is done  you can try  some of  the test examples in
TESTS. You can for example go to TESTS_COO and
type 

 make all

 which will make the executables :
        arms.ex, ilut.ex, iluc.ex, iluk.ex, vbilut, and vbiluk

 then you can execute the script 
 
 runall to run all these drivers with the two sample matrices provided
 in .\MATRICES [two for TESTS_COO and two for TESTS_HB] 

The makefile in  TESTS will require that the user edit the links to
blas and lapack in the LINKS directive.

To test  a single preconditioner, for example  the arms preconditioner
type for matrices stored in coo format type:

make arms.ex 

This should create an executable called arms.ex 

Typing arms.ex should  run this for the sample  matrices in coordinate
format located in SAMPLE_MATRICES and  for the input parameters in the
file inputs.   [two sample matrices are provided  in coordinate format
and two in the hb format]
