'MATRICES/SHERMAN5' 'SHERMAN5'

first line is the number of matrices to be tested  [called numat in drivers] 
 
The second line gives the full path name of the file
and the name of the file, this may be something like
'/project/scicom00/DATA/MATRICES/MATRICES/SIMON/RAEFSKY6' 'RAEFSKY6'
the name is printed in the output table

Repeat for as many matrices as indicated by numat
