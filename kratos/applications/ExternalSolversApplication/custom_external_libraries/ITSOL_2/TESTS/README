Once you have compiled the library -- you can test *all* the drivers in this
directory by using the shell script 'runall' [just type ./runall] 

A few details on the input files and matrices.. The input was designed so all
runs can be executed with the same input file - so in some cases a few parameters
will be ignored [for example block-size is used in arms but not in ilut. and block
size means something different for arms when ddpq is used (last block size)] 
See the corresponding drivers. 

The drivers can read matrices stored in 3 different formats.

1. Harwell boeing format. [HB] -- old style HB format with fortran indexing

2. Matrices in matrix market format with fortran style indexing [MM1] 
   row/column indices start at 1 

3. Matrices in matrix market format with C-style indexing [MM0] 
   row/column indices start at 0 

The file matfile contains a list of matrices to test. 
It starts by a integer k indicating the number of systems to consider followed
k lines, one for each matrix. Each line has the form

pathname  short-name  TYP

pathname is the full pathname of the data. short-name is a short name
for the matrix used mainly to name corresponding output files. Finally
TYP is one of HB, MM0, or MM1 - see above. Here is an example of a matfile

 /scratch/syphax/MATRICES3/Florida/circuit_3.mtx circuit3 MM1
 /scratch/syphax/MATRICES3/MatrixMarket/cry10000.rua cry10000 HB
 ./MATRICES/mat.coo small MM0

A few matrices are provided in the directory MATRICES.
