=======================================================================

This library contains a  number of  classic and  new preconditioners.
There are several ways in  which you can use these preconditioners for
solving a linear  system.  The  easiest way  is probably  to  use the
sample drivers  provided in the directory TESTS as templates. 
TESTS contains test codes for matrices in coordinate or
matrix-market format and in the old Harwell-Boeing format.  
Each if these drivers has a name of the form
mainPRECON.c where PRECON is one of

 ILUK     standard ILU preconditioner with level of fill 
 ILUT     standard ILU preconditioner with threshold 
 ILUC     standard ILU preconditioner with threshold - Crout version
 ARMS     Algebraic Multilevel Solvers == This includes both the 
          standard ARMS and a version with nonsymmetric permutations
          which reorders the matrix by diagonal dominance
 VBILUT   Variable Block ILUT preconditioner
 VBILUK   Variable Block ILUK preconditioner

For  example, mainILUT.c  is  a driver  which  reads a  matrix in  a
Harwell-Boeing/Matrix-market format (or a sequence of such matrices for 
consecutive tests--see below), then constructs an ILUT preconditioner 
and proceeds to solve the system with the accelerator fgmres. There is
only  one accelerator  used  for the  iteration  phase, namely  FGMRES
(fgmr.c).  This uses two wrapper structs

 MAT for the matrix [for matvecs] 
 PRE for the preconditoner (preconditioning operation). 

These  structs  include substructs  for  each  of the  data-structures
required by the above  preconditioners and pointers to functions. Only
one of these, along with  one matvec function needs to be instantiated
(set) for  the MAT  struct. Similarly one  member and  a corresponding
function  pointer of  PRE needs  to  be instantiated.  Thus, a  driver
mainPREC does the following steps

 1/ read the matrix in Harwell-Boeing/coo format
 2/ convert it to any required format 
 3/ construct the preconditioner -- get its struct -- say LU
 4/ set MAT, PRE [by filling the appropriate members] 
 5/ call fgmr(MAT, PRE, + other parameters).
 6/ output various results in OUT/PRECON.out 

Once you  are familiar with  the preconditioners and  various structs,
you should  be able to  bypass the wrapper  structs MAT and  PREC.  In
fact a second way of using  the preconditioner is to build it directly
by  a  call  to  the  appropriate  function and  then  call  your  own
accelerator. For example, fgmr can be easily modified to pass directly
the structs needed for the iteration.  Thus, if your preconditioner is
ILUK and  you have the 'iluptr' struct LU and the 'csptr' struct CSMAT
for the  preconditioner and matrix respectively, you  can simply issue
the call

    call fgmr(CSmat, LU, + other parameters).

and  replace  the matvec  routines  and  preconditioner  calls by  the
appropriate ones == These are available in LIB/MatOps.c

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ILU*      These are the standard ILU(k), ILUT, preconditioners and the
           new, Crout-based ILU preconditoner. ILUT and ILUK are simple
           translations of the corresonding version in the old sparskit.
           ILUC is new and it is written in an "experimental" version
           which allows various dropping strategies [5 different ones] 

	   drivers: mainILUT,  mainILUK,  mainILUC, and
           these produce the executables
                    ilut.ex     iluk.ex     iluc.ex 

 ARMS      Algebraic Multilevel Solvers.  This includes both the 
           standard ARMS and a version with nonsymmetric permutations
           which reorders the matrix by diagonal dominance. 
                      
           drivers mainARM
           which produce the executable   arms.ex

 VB        block variants of ILUT and ILUK preconditioners with variable
	   blocks. 

           drivers mainVBILUT, mainVBILUK
           which produce the executables  vbilut.ex and vbiluk.ex

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------- DETAILS ON THE DRIVERS ---------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each main driver reads input parameters from the file 
	
 inputs

This is done with the  function "read_inputs". The parameters that are
read are the same for all drivers  - though some of these are not used
by the drivers.  For example  droptol is not used by the level-of-fill
techniques  [iluk].  Note  that   the  arms  drivers  set  some  other
parameters to a default via the `set_arms_params' function -- which is
in the 'auxill.c' file.

The execution  of the driver consists of looping through  a number of
matrices  in harwell-boeing/MM format and  for  each of  them, a  preset
number of tests is done. The list  of matrices used for the test is in
the file:
 
matfile

These files begin with a number "nmat" of matrices to be read followed
by  nmat lines  each  consisting of  a  pathname for  the matrix  file
followed by a short name that will be used for creating out filenames
and the matrix format [HB: harwell-boeing; MM1:matrix-market 1-indexing,
MM0:matrix-market 0-indexing].
The other major  loop in the driver will  loop through parameters. The
parameters for  dropping are tightened  at each loop as  instructed by
the choice of lfilInc (how  to increase the lfil parameter) and tolMul
(scalar by which to multiply the drop tolerance at each new loop). 

SAMPLE_MATRICES: two

-------------- porting itsol solvers into packages----------------------- 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is recommended  to test the various solvers  with different options
to see what  works best. For this it is useful  to imitate the general
framework of the  drivers provided.  You can for  example generate the
matrix in  coordinate format and then  convert it to  the internal csr
format  (called SparMat)  by the  function COOcs.   Then you  can call
whatever  preconditioner set-up  function (e.g.   ilut) to  obtain the
desired preconditioner- The pointers in MAT and PRE can then be set --
for example when using ILUT:

      MAT->n = n;                         matrix size
      MAT->CSR = csmat;                   matrix A itself [for matvecs]
      MAT->matvec = matvecCSR;            ptr to matvec routine 
      PRE->ILU = lu;                      preconditioner struct
      PRE->precon = preconILU;            ptr to corresponding precon oper.

You are now ready to call the accelerator:

      fgmr(MAT, PRE, rhs, sol, tol, krydim, itmax, outputs);

-------------------------------------------------- updated Apr. 7th, 2008

A few of the changes in the April 2008 version 
 
** quite a few small fixes.

** added test codes for the COO format -- this is the same essentially as
   the matrix-market format. 

** chaged a few names -- SparRow became SparMat -- VBsparRow became 
   VBSparMat. nnzrow became nzcount. These changes were made to avoid
   confusions [in fact confusion lead to some small errors in earlier
   versions].. Specifically nnzrow used to count number of nonzeros in
   rows or in columns.. 

** ILUC [or possibly just the main routine calling it] seems to have a
   problem -- it will put back after this is fixed. 

-------
** New I/O routine which can handle 3 formats: 
   1. HB 
   2. MM-1-indexing
   3. MM-0-indexing
** TESTS_HB and TESTS_COO (in old version) are merged to TESTS
