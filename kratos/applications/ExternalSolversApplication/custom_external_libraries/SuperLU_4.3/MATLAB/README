This directory contains the following Matlab script files, 
which can be invoked in Matlab:

    superlu.m      Supernodal LU factorization
    lusolve.m      Solve linear systems by supernodal LU factorization
    trysuperlu.m   Test the Matlab interface to SUPERLU
    trylusolve.m   Test the Matlab interface to LUSOLVE
    copyright.m    Complete copyright and licensing notice

Say HELP SUPERLU and HELP LUSOLVE to Matlab for details.

    The Makefile is set up so that the MEX-files are compatible with Matlab
    Version 5. For Version 4 compatibility, you need to change
	FLAGS   = -O -DV5
    to
	FLAGS	= -O -V4
    in Makefile.
