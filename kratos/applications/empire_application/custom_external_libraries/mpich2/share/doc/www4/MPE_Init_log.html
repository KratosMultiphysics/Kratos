Initialize the logging of events. 
<H2>Synopsis</H2>
<PRE>
int MPE_Init_log( void )
</PRE>
<H2>Notes</H2>
This routine must be called before any of the other MPE logging routines.
It is a collective call over 'MPI_COMM_WORLD'.
MPE_Init_log() &amp; MPE_Finish_log() are NOT needed when liblmpe.a is linked
because MPI_Init() would have called MPE_Init_log() already.
liblmpe.a will be included in the link path if either "mpicc -mpe=mpilog"
or "mpecc -mpilog" is used in the link step.
<P>
This function is threadsafe, but
MPE_Init_log() is expected to be called on only one thread in each
process.  This thread will be labelled as main thread.
<P>
<H2>Returns</H2>
Always return MPE_LOG_OK.
