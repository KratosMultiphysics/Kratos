<DT><B>ng   </B><DD>Number in group.  This many processes are allowed to execute

<H2>Notes</H2>
'MPE_Seq_begin' and 'MPE_Seq_end' provide a way to force a section of code
to
be executed by the processes in rank order.  Typically, this is done
with
<PRE>
  MPE_Seq_begin( comm, 1 );
  &lt;code to be executed sequentially&gt;
  MPE_Seq_end( comm, 1 );
</PRE>

Often, the sequential code contains output statements (e.g., 'printf') to
be executed.  Note that you may need to flush the I/O buffers before
calling 'MPE_Seq_end'; also note that some systems do not propagate I/O in
any
order to the controling terminal (in other words, even if you flush the
output, you may not get the data in the order that you want).
