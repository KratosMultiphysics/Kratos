<H2>Synopsis</H2>
<PRE>
int MPE_Finish_log( const char *filename )
</PRE>
<H2>Notes</H2>
MPE_Finish_log() &amp; MPE_Init_log() are NOT needed when liblmpe.a is linked
because MPI_Finalize() would have called MPE_Finish_log() already.
liblmpe.a will be included in the final executable if it is linked with
either "mpicc -mpe=mpilog" or "mpecc -mpilog"
<P>
This routine outputs the logfile in CLOG2 format, i.e.
a collective call over 'MPI_COMM_WORLD'.
<P>
This function is threadsafe, but
MPE_Finish_log() is expected to be called only on the main thread
which initializes MPE logging through MPE_Init_log().
<P>
<H2>Returns</H2>
Always return MPE_LOG_OK.
