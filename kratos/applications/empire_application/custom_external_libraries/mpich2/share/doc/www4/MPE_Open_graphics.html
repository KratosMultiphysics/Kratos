<H2>Input Parameters</H2>
<DL>
<DT><B>comm </B><DD>Communicator of participating processes

<P>
<DT><B>display </B><DD>Name of X window display.  If NULL, display will be taken
from the local DISPLAY variable on each process. If the local DISPLAY is
undefined, the DISPLAY variable of the process with rank 0 in 'comm'
will be used.  If that is either undefined then the value of display is
``hostname``:0, or if it starts with w ":xy", then the value of
display is ``hostname``:xy.

<P>
<DT><B>x,y </B><DD>position of the window.  If '(-1,-1)', then the user should be
asked to position the window (this is a window manager issue).

<DT><B>w,h </B><DD>width and height of the window, in pixels.

<DT><B>is_collective </B><DD>true if the graphics operations are collective; this
allows the MPE graphics operations to make fewer connections to the 
display.  If false, then all processes in the communicator comm will 
open the display; this could exceed the number of connections that your
X window server allows.  Not yet implemented.
</DL>
<P>
<H2>Output Parameter</H2>
<DL><DT><B>handle </B> <DD> Graphics handle to be given to other MPE graphics routines.
</DL>
<P>
<H2>Notes</H2>
This is a collective routine.  All processes in the given communicator
must call it, and it has the same semantics as 'MPI_Barrier' (that is,
other collective operations can not cross this routine).
<P>
<P>
<H2>Notes For Fortran Interface </H2>
The Fortran interface to this routine is different from its C
counterpart and it has an additional argument, ierr, at the end
of the argument list, i.e. the returned function value (the error
code) in C interface is returned as the additional argument in
Fortran interface.  The Fortran interface is invoked with the
CALL statement.
<P>
All MPI and MPE objects, MPI_Comm, MPE_XGraph and MPE_Color, are
of type INTEGER in Fortran.
<P>
<H2>Additional Notes for Fortran Interface </H2>
If Fortran 'display' argument is an empty string, "", display will be
taken from the DISPLAY variable on the process with rank 0 in 'comm'.
The trailing blanks in Fortran CHARACTER string argument will be
ignored.
