.TH MPE_Init_log 4 "6/15/2009" " " "MPE"
.SH NAME
MPE_Init_log \-  Initialize the logging of events. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
int MPE_Init_log( void )
.fi
.SH NOTES
This routine must be called before any of the other MPE logging routines.
It is a collective call over 'MPI_COMM_WORLD'.
MPE_Init_log() & MPE_Finish_log() are NOT needed when liblmpe.a is linked
because MPI_Init() would have called MPE_Init_log() already.
liblmpe.a will be included in the link path if either "mpicc -mpe=mpilog"
or "mpecc -mpilog" is used in the link step.

This function is threadsafe, but
MPE_Init_log() is expected to be called on only one thread in each
process.  This thread will be labelled as main thread.

.SH RETURNS
Always return MPE_LOG_OK.
