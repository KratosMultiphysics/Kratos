This directory contains some examples (not useful, only illustratives) of
interfacing with the library gidpost.

testpostfor.f is a small FORTRAN sample, using the gidpost.lib library to write
GiD postprocess mesh and results.

testpost.c is another small sample, but using "C/C++".


To compile using MS Developer Studio (for example using Compaq Visual FORTRAN):

1- Compile first the library gidpost.lib (read gidpost.html)

2- Create a new Fortran Console application project and add testpostfor.f to the
   source files (or a Win32 Console Application and add testpost.c for the "C"
   sample)

3- Change the Link Input category setting, adding gidpost.lib to "Object/Library
   modules", and the location of this library in "Additional library path"
