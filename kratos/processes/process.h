/// The base class for all processes in Kratos.
/** The process is the base class for all processes and defines a simple interface for them.
    Execute method is used to execute the Process algorithms. While the parameters of this method
  can be very different from one Process to other there is no way to create enough overridden
  versions of it. For this reason this method takes no argument and all Process parameters must
  be passed at construction time. The reason is that each constructor can take different set of
  argument without any dependency to other processes or the base Process class.
