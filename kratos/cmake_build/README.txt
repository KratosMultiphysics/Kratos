This directory is designed for building Kratos using the cmake tool

to compile first of all copy the example file to your own, say local_compile.sh

    cp example_configure.sh.do_not_touch local_compile.sh

and edit local_compile.sh ... to customarize it following your taste.

then run (assuming the file you copied to is local_compile.sh)

    sh local_compile.sh

hopefully you should enjoy the kratos compilation with CMAKE
